    /* In Rust there are two types of dat type
       subsets: Scalar and Compound */

    // 1. Scalar Type
    /* Rust has four primary scalar types
       1. integers, -> i8, i16, i32, i64, i128
       2. floating point number,
       3. boolean 
       4. and characters. 
       
    
    1. Integer:
       An integer is a number without a fractional
       component. 

       -----------------------------------------
          Length      Signed       Unsigned
       -----------------------------------------
          8-bit       i8           u8
          16-bit      i16          u16
          32-bit      i32          u32
          64-bit      i64          u64
          128-bit     i128         ui28
       
       Signed and unsigned refer to whether it’s possible 
       for the number to be negative—in other words, whether 
       the number needs to have a sign with it (signed) or 
       whether it will only ever be positive and can 
       therefore be represented without a sign (unsigned).
       
       ? let his_age: i8 = -24; -> Signed Integer
       * let her_age: u8 = 24;  -> Unsigned Integer 
       
       Additionally, the isize and usize types depend on the 
       architecture of the computer your program is running on, 
       which is denoted in the table as “arch”: 64 bits if 
       you’re on a 64-bit architecture and 32 bits if you’re 
       on a 32-bit architecture.
