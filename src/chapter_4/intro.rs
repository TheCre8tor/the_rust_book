    /* SECTION  1. What is ownership:
      Ownership is a set of rules that governs how a Rust program manages memory. 

      ? The Stack ->
        The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values 
        in the opposite order. This is referred to as last in, first out.

        Adding data is called pushing onto the stack, and removing data is called 
        popping off the stack. 
        
        All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an 
        unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored 
        on the heap instead.
