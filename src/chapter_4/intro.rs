    /* SECTION  1. What is ownership:
      Ownership is a set of rules that governs how a Rust program manages memory. 

      ? The Stack ->
        The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values 
        in the opposite order. This is referred to as last in, first out.

        * Adding data is called pushing onto the stack, and removing data is 
        * called popping off the stack. 
        
        All data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an 
        unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored 
        on the heap instead.

      ? The Heap ->
        The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a 
        certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the 
        heap that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a pointer, 
        which is the address of that location.

        ? Because the pointer to the heap is a known, fixed size, you can store 
        ? the pointer on the stack, but when you want the actual data, you must 
        ? follow the pointer.

        * This process is called allocating on the heap and is sometimes 
        * abbreviated as just allocating.

        * Pushing values onto the stack is not considered allocating.

        Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because 
        the allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; 
        that location is always at the top of the stack. 

        * Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack 
        * because you have to follow a pointer to get there.

        ? When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function 
        ? (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the 
        ? functionâ€™s local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function 
        ? is over, those values get popped off the stack.

        ! The main purpose of ownership is to manage heap data.
